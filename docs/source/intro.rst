Developing rigorously validated computational mesoscale models is the key requirement of the Integrated Computational Materials Science and Engineering (ICMSE) approach for the design of critical polycrystalline structural components. These models must accurately predict the occurrence of local heterogeneities, e.g., hot spots in stress or strain at the grain scale where damage nucleation typically occurs, and finally cause failure of the parts during their service life. The **M**\ icromechanical **A**\ nalysis of **S**\ tress-**S**\ train **I**\ nhomogeneities with fast **F**\ ourier transforms (MASSIF) code is a reimplementation of the elasto-viscoplastic fast Fourier transform-based (EVPFFT) code of Lebensohn et al. This FFT-based formulation, originally developed by Moulinec and Suquet for linear composites, was improved by Michel et al. in terms of its numerical convergence, to allow accurate prediction of local micromechanical fields in non-linear composites. Lebensohn et al. developed an elasto-viscoplastic version (EVPFFT) of the latter formulation for micromechanical predictions of plastically-deforming polycrystals. Such FFT-based methods use input from an image of the initial microstructure discretized on a regular grid, and calculate local strain and stress fields at each grid point that respectively fulfill equilibrium and compatibility under the applied boundary conditions. In certain cases, they are linked to packages such as DREAM.3D that provide tools for analyzing 3D images of materials microstructure and generating synthetic microstructures for further study.
